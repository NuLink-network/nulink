# Watcher Network

In order to enable privacy-preserving schemes deployed on specific chain to be used in all ecosystems, (for example, we want to reflect the PRE service performed by Ursulas on Ethereum to Polkadot and Solana)ï¼Œwe deployed The Watcher Network, using Blockchain Interoperation. Blockchain interoperation is the technology that allows two or more different block chain systems can read, write and transmit information to each other. All we need first is reading operation.
