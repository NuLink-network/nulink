# NuLink

*Solution for Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Applications*

----------

NuLink is a decentralized solution for privacy-preserving application where we combine best practices with best of breed solutions. Nulink has  blockchain, access control (Proxy Re-Encryption, Attribute-Based Encryption) and secure computation (Zero-Knowledge Proof, Secure Multi-party Computation, Fully Homomorphic Encryption) as technical core, and it provides enterprise-level privacy data sharing and computation services.

## Overview
*Overview of Nulink Network*

----------


By integrating best in class technologies we are building a strong technology foundation. 

The Nulink network integrates the Application Layer, the Cryptograph Layer, the Storage Layer, the Blockchain Layer and the Watcher Network.

Nulink users can simply integrate into one single API and get access to multiple storage and BlockChain solutions. For key management we integrate into Nucyper. 

Specifically, clients use the Application Layer to select privacy-preserving services and authorize to the Cryptograph Layer. In the first step, NuLink mainly provides secret data sharing service through proxy re-encryption, and will do more in the future. The Cryptograph Layer connects the Application Layer, the Blockchain Layer and the Storage Layer, and it has the function of encryption and decryption. After receiving the authorization from the Application Layer, it can interact with the Storage Layer to perform encryption and upload, or download and decryption operations. The Blockchain Layer can include ETH, Polkadot, Solana and so on. For proxy re-encryption requests in ETH, through Ursulas nodes deployed on ETH by Nucypher, we can directly provide proxy re-encryption services. For proxy re-encryption requests in Polkadot or other ecosystems, we build The Watcher Network. The Watcher Network would relay the information of Ursulas nodes from Ethereum to Polkadot (or other ecosystems). Then the proxy re-encryption implemented through Ursulas can be reflected in Polkadot (or other ecosystems).

Miners can get our token NLK in storage layer by providing decentralized storage services and also in watcher layer by relaying information from ETH.
